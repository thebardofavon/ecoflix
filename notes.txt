Asynchronous Operations
Asynchronous operations in JavaScript allow the program to continue executing other tasks while waiting for an operation to complete. These operations don't block the execution of the code. Common examples include:

Network requests (e.g., fetching data from a server)
File reading/writing
Timers (e.g., setTimeout, setInterval)
Asynchronous operations are essential for handling tasks that may take an unknown amount of time, such as retrieving data from a remote server, without freezing the entire application.

Promises
A Promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. It allows you to attach handlers for the success (then) or failure (catch) of the operation, providing a more structured and readable way to handle asynchronous code compared to traditional callbacks.

Conclusion
Callbacks are the traditional way to handle asynchronous operations but can lead to complex and hard-to-read code.
Promises provide a more modern, readable, and manageable way to handle asynchronous operations, supporting better error handling and chaining.
